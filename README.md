# Developing a Python app using Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed multi-model database. One of the supported APIs is the DocumentDB API, which provides a JSON document model with SQL querying and JavaScript procedural logic. This sample shows you how to use the Azure Cosmos DB with the DocumentDB API to store and access data from a Python application.

## Running this sample

* Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
    * [Visual Studio 2015](http://www.visualstudio.com/) or higher.
    * Python Tools for Visual Studio from [GitHub](http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/).
    * Python 2.7 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/)

* Then, clone this repository using `git clone git@github.com:arramac/azure-cosmos-db-documentdb-python-getting-started.git`

* Next, substitute the endpoint and authorization key in `DocumentDBGetStarted.py` with your Cosmos DB account's values. 

* Press F5 to run the application.

## About the code
The code included in this sample is intended to get you quickly started with a Python application that connects to Azure Cosmos DB with the DocumentDB API.
